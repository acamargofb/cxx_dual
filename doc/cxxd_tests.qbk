[section Tests]

The CXXD tests encompass tests for the individual variadic macros which
CXXD supports to make using CXXD in a library easier, and for the individual
CXXD-mods.

The tests for the individual variadic macros aiding library support,
CXXD_LIBRARY_NAME and CXXD_VALID_VARIANTS, require variadic macro
support but do not necessarily require C++11 on up mode in most
compilers, since the major compilers support variadic macros without
necessarily supporting C++11. These include clang, gcc, and VC++. However
because these compilers may issue numerous warnings about variadic macro
usage without being in C++11 mode, while still working correctly as far as the
two variadic macros are concerned, warnings are turned off in the tests so as not to flood
the end-user with spurious warnings. These tests are not dependent on any
CXXD-mod and are therefore always run when the tests are run.

The tests for the individual CXXD-mods do depend on other Boost libraries
when the Boost dual library is chosen for the individual CXXD-mod. Therefore
these tests are marked 'explicit' in terms of Boost Build, which means that
they are not run normally when running the CXXD tests. All of these tests for the 
individual CXXD-mods are under a Boost Build alias called 'mods'. Therefore in 
order to just run these tests the command line should be:

  b2 mods ...any_other_b2_parameters
  
whereas:

  b2 ...any_other_b2_parameters
  
will just run the variadic macro tests.

In order to run all the tests the command line therefore would be:

  b2 . mods ...any_other_b2_parameters
