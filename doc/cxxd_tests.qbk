[section Tests]

The CXXD tests encompass tests for the individual variadic macros which
CXXD supports to make using CXXD in a library easier, for the individual
mods, and for the test_vv.cpp compilation previously discussed. The tests
are in the CXXD 'test' sub-directory so running the tests in general is a matter
of being in that subdirectory and invoking 'b2' as appropriate:

  b2 any_other_b2_parameters...
  
The tests for the individual variadic macros aiding library support,
CXXD_LIBRARY_NAME and CXXD_VALID_VARIANTS, require variadic macro
support but do not necessarily require C++11 mode in most
compilers, since the major compilers support variadic macros without
necessarily supporting C++11. These include clang, gcc, and VC++. However
because these compilers may issue numerous warnings about variadic macro
usage without being in C++11 mode, while still working correctly as far as the
two variadic macros are concerned, warnings are turned off in the tests so as not to flood
the end-user with spurious warnings. These tests are not dependent on any
mod and are therefore always run when the tests are run.

These tests are divided
into two separate Boost Build aliases, 'ln' for the library name tests
and 'vv' for the valid variant tests. So you could decide to run
only the tests for either of the particular aliases by specifying
them on the command line, as in:

  b2 ln any_other_b2_parameters...
  
or
  
  b2 vv any_other_b2_parameters...
  
The tests for the individual mods do depend on other Boost libraries
when the Boost dual library is chosen for the individual mod. Therefore
these tests are marked 'explicit' in terms of Boost Build, which means that
they are not run normally when running the CXXD tests. All of these tests for the 
individual mods are under a Boost Build alias called 'mods'. Therefore in 
order to just run these tests the command line should be:

  b2 mods any_other_b2_parameters...
  
The valid variant test call test_vv.cpp under the alias 'tvv'
has already been discussed. This test, like the tests for the individual
mods is also marked 'explicit', which means that it will not
be ordinarily run unless it is explicitly invoked by:
  
  b2 tvv any_other_b2_parameters...
  
The other b2 parameters necessary to run the valid variant test have
previously been discussed.
  
In order to run the default tests as well as any of the explicit tests
you can execute:

  b2 . explicit_test_aliases... any_other_b2_parameters...
  
as in:

  b2 . mods any_other_b2_parameters...
  
in order to run the default tests and the mod explicit tests.
