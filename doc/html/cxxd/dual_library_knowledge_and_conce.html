<p>
      Using a dual library, as CXXD does, means that a programmer should have knowledge
      of any differences which may exist between the Boost implementation of a dual
      library and the C++ standard implementation of that same dual library.
    </p>
<p>
      There are a number of areas for the programmer to consider when using a particular
      dual library:
    </p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
<li class="listitem">
          Does the particular syntax being used function in the same way for each
          dual library implentation ?
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Can one-off code be written for situations in which the implementation
          of a dual library differs ?
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Does a compiler implementation of the C++ standard library implementation
          of a dual library correspond to what the C++ standard requires ?
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          If the compiler being used changes will dual library code still work as
          expected ?
        </li>
</ol></div>
<p>
      All of the above are valid concerns. I have had expressed to me that using
      CXXD is not a valid choice to use because it masks the issues I bring up above.
      I can understand that point of view. Furthermore I have had it expressed to
      me that CXXD should somehow document any differences between the implementation
      of the Boost library and the C++ standard library for each of the dual libraries
      supported. Again this is a valid point of view, but I do not think the CXXD
      library is the place for such documentation.
    </p>
<p>
      The design of CXXD is that the advantages of being able to offer to the programmer
      the choice of using either the Boost implementation or the C++ standard implementation
      of a dual library, while using both with the same code, offsets the issues
      above and the concerns of others in using CXXD in the designer's mind. But
      I am aware of the issues and concerns stated above and want to mention them
      here in the documentation to CXXD.
    </p>
<p>
      The issues and concerns are very much the same whenever a particular implementation
      of any library is chosen, whether that library is a Boost library, a C++ standard
      library, or a 3rd party library. That each mod really involves two different
      implementations, or libraries if you will, is something I have made plain in
      the documentation, and I want to reiterate it here. Knowledge of those libraries,
      for any particular mod, is still of first importance in programming using CXXD.
      Essentially CXXD is a framework for supporting dual libraries, but it is not
      an excuse for not understanding the functionality of a particular dual library
      in the first place.
    </p>
<p>
      Although I have done so in other areas of the documentation I would like to
      again emphasize the importance of documenting when a dual library is being
      used by the end-user. This is especially true when CXXD is being used in a
      third party library, whether that library is a header-only library or non-header
      only library where some part of the library is being built into a shared or
      static library. Without documenting that a particular dual library is being
      used a programmer cannot know, depending on the compiler implementation and
      the compiler's command line parameters, that either the Boost implementation
      or the C++ standard implementation of the dual library is being used in the
      code.
