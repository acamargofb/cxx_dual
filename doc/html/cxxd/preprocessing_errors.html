<p>
      CXXD errors are preprocessor errors issue by the CXXD library using the preprocessor
      '#error' directive. These errors occur when the inclusion of a CXXD-mod produces
      inconsistencies which CXXD does not allow. These inconsistencies can be found,
      in a TU, either the first time CXXD includes a particular CXXD header file
      or subsequent times CXXD includes a particular CXXD header.
    </p>
<p>
      The errors which can occur involve four different situations for which CXXD
      issues the "#error' directive. These situations are, for any given CXXD-mod
      called 'xxx':
    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
          If override macros for both Boost and the C++ standard library occur when
          a particular CXXD header is included, an '#error' directive is emitted
          of 'CXXD: Using C++ standard and using Boost are both defined for xxx'.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          If the C++ standard library has been previously chosen and is subsequently
          overridden by the Boost library, an '#error' directive is emitted of 'CXXD:
          Previous use of C++ standard xxx erroneously overridden'.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          If the Boost standard library has been previously chosen and is subsequently
          overridden by the C++ standard library, an '#error' directive is emitted
          of 'CXXD: Previous use of Boost xxx erroneously overridden'.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          If override macros for the C++ standard library occur but the C++ standard
          library is not available for the CXXD-mod xxx, an '#error' directive is
          emitted of 'CXXD: C++ standard xxx is not available'.
        </li>
</ul></div>
<p>
      As previously stated in the documentation CXXD-mod header files are processed
      each time they are included to avoid inconsistencies.
    </p>
<p>
      The first error listed above could happen either the first time a particular
      CXXD header is included or a subsequent time a particular CXXD header is included,
      since override macros could occur at any time in a TU. It is not possible to
      eliminate this error message for the situation in which it would occur, since
      conflicting CXXD override macros always means that CXXD cannot choose the correct
      dual library for a particular CXXD-mod.
    </p>
<p>
      The second and third errors listed above can only happen at a subsequent time
      a particular CXXD-mod is included, since either message occurs when an override
      macro changes the dual library choice from a previous inclusion of the CXXD
      header. As explained previously when discussing overriding the default dual
      library <a class="link" href="choosing_the_dual_library/header_file_inclusion.html#mechanism_noconsistency">consistency</a>, you can
      eliminate the second and third errors for the situation in which it would occur
      by defining CXXD_NO_CONSISTENCY, although it is generally not a recommended
      thing to do so.
    </p>
<p>
      The last error message can only occur the first time a particular CXXD-mod
      is included, where an override macro for the C++ standard library fails because
      the library is not available. Like the second and third errors listed above
      it is possible to eliminate this last error message for the situation in which
      it would occurs. You can do this by defining the object-like macro CXXD_NO_CONFIG
      to nothing as in:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting"><span class="preprocessor">#define</span> <span class="identifier">CXXD_NO_CONFIG</span>
</pre>
<p>
      before including the particular CXXD-mod. This object-like macro allows an
      override macro for the C++ standard library to choose the particular CXXD-mod's
      C++ standard library equivalent as the dual library even when Boost.Config
      determines that the C++ standard library equivalent is not available when compiling
      the TU.
    </p>
<p>
      There are two reasons for allowing this object-macro to eliminate the particular
      preprocessor error message:
    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
          The end-user may still want CXXD to use the equivalent C++ standard library
          for a particular CXX-mod even when Boost.Config says it is not available.
          This could be because of some obscure configuration that Boost.Config does
          not know about for a given OS/compiler combination. A compiler error or
          linker error, as opposed to a preprocessor error, might still show up when
          the end-user codes as if the C++ standard library for that CXXD-mod exists
          when it does not do so.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          The object-like macro allows tests for CXXD facilities to be run as if
          the C++ standard library were available even when it is not. This includes
          tests for the functionality of the CXXD_LIBRARY_NAME and CXXD_VALID_VARIANTS
          macro. In other words if no further use of the particular CXXD-mod's C++
          standard library equivalent subsequently exists in the TU there is no reason
          to disallow it when including the particular CXXD header.
        </li>
</ul></div>
<p>
      Eliminating this last of CXXD's preprocessor #error messages, and allowing
      a macro override to choose a particular CXXD-mod's C++ standard equivalent
      dual library even when Boost.Config says it does not exist, should very rarely
      ever be done.
